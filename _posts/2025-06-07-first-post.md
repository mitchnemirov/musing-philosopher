Well, here we are! This is my first post on my new new new new blog! *Yes I've tried to keep up a blog that many times... don't judge me*. Let's get into it I guess. Today's topic is: **WRITING**.

#### What is Writing?

That may seem like a silly question, but it goes deeper than just putting pen on paper *(or finger to keyboard... keyboard to screen? whatever, the digital kind)*. Writing is one of the few things that elevates humankind as a species, and goes back as far as 3400 BC[^writing-origins] with the ancient Sumerians and Egyptians. The process of writing has taken on many forms throughout history, with different languages across the world having their own distinct written dialects *(on top of distinct spoken dialects)*. But we're not looking for the historically accurate definition of writing as a concept, nor do we need to explore all the possible languages where the spoken and written word differed based on region and time period. We just need something we mere mortals can digest and understand in general conversation. So, *what is writing*?

Put simply, writing is the act of encapsulating ones thoughts and transposing them into a form that is easily understandable for others. It can take on many forms and be formatted for a multitude of purposes including: journalism, technical documentation, prose, poetry, storytelling, and even code! And though the written word can take on many different forms, all writing shares at least one very important aspect: it conveys information to the reader. If the reader does not gain any information, however useful or relevant, then the written thing must be incomplete or simply nonsense. Now, this does not preclude one from practicing a writing technique known colloquially as *Word Vomit*. I know, it sounds gross, but hear me out and I'll explain not only what this technique entails, but also why it is ***important***.

#### Word Vomit: Technique

Have you ever experienced *stuckness*? If you're a writer of any kind you'll know this as the dreaded *writer's block*. If you work in design or make art you'll know this as a *creative block* or *idea block*. It comes in many forms, but in all these things there exists a simple yet effective method to get the mental juices flowing, so to speak. For writing it's called a *word vomit* and it's a way to write **outside** of the stuck project's scope in order to get words out of your head.

The process is simply this: Grab a pen & paper *(digital works too, but I find it works better the old fashioned way)* and start writing every single thought that pops into your head. Literally all of it, leave nothing out, do not edit anything. Just write.

What this does, is remove the burden of fitment. Because you aren't thinking about how this will fit into your story or integrate with your already-written documentation or literally whatever you're writing, you're able to shut off your mental filters, break down the walls of structure, and just put thought to paper.

#### Word Vomit: Why it's important

This technique is probably the most important tool in the proverbial writer's toolbelt *(writer's proverbial toolbelt?)* because it allows for **uncaring**. I know that sounds oddly negative but I promise it's not. Uncaring is just freedom from the restrictive nature of adding onto an existing written work, regardless of its format. With no restrictions on what comes out of your head, you don't have to be mindful of the writing to make any sense at all! You can write complete gibberish and it would be fine. Because it's about clearing out your mind, like a sort of factory reset.

#### Why is writing important?

Now that we've sorted out what the Word Vomit technique is, back to the core of writing: information delivery. The kind of information being delivered depends on the kind of writing being done. For journalists, they're trying to write eye-catching pieces that capture the reader's attention as quickly as possible and hooks them into the story. For authors, they're trying to create a story *(this applies to both fiction & non-fiction)* that pulls the reader into a new world. Technical writers are attempting to convey instructions, documentation, or simply information about the software or hardware they support. Heck, me sitting here drafting this blog post is a form of writing that's a cross between journalism and technical writing. 

So what? Is writing exclusively to accomplish the goal of giving someone information; is it merely work? I say ***NO***. Writing can, *and should*, be done for fun. Literally this blog is for fun; I don't expect anything out of it and frankly can't imagine what it would look like to have regular readers. And I fervently believe that everyone, and I mean *everyone* should write. Whether it be journaling about your day, writing poems or short-stories, or word vomit-ing nonsense to clear your head, writing is a healthy activity that gets your brain working and the creative juices flowing.

#### Now What?

Go write. That's it, just go write. You can write to me if you so wish[^socials], you can write in a journal or using Obsidian[^obsidian] *(fantastic writing tool, by the way)*, or any number of other methods available, many for free. Writing is a great way to get thoughts down, avoiding taking up valuable space in your mind, and unlocking your potential for creating something new. It's one of the many ways you can make your voice heard, share your story or some piece of fiction, write a review or a recipe. Writing is a gateway to universes beyond our normal reality, that allows us to think about things in a new light.

Anyway, thanks for reading! Hope this made sense *(or not ;P)*. See ya around.
