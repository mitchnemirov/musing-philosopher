## Who is this Mitch guy anyway?

Well, that's a complicated question. But to put it simply, it me!

I am a coffee & tea enjoyer (some would say caffeine addict), gamer extraordinaire (I absolutely suck at video games but I love 'em), Dudeist Minister (yes, it's [real, *and free!*](https://dudeism.com)), and consider myself an eccentric who studies philosophy (much more in the past) and works with/in technology.

I studied philosophy in university and continue to explore philosophical ideas and topics from time to time. Contemplating life and the way things are has always been fascinating to me, and sometimes I feel like sharing, so here we are.

I attempt to keep up with various tech news and interesting projects. I'm a jack-of-all-trades tech guy with a focus on systems administration and infrastructure automation / management. I have a full-time job doing this alongside a freelance consulting business.

## What is this website for?

That's an even more complicated question.

Lately (mid-2025) I've been thinking about starting up a blog (again) where I can drop my thoughts on, well, anything I want. They can be on a philosophical discussion/paper, interesting technology (tool, project, etc), or just my thoughts on life, love, religion, and other stuff.
